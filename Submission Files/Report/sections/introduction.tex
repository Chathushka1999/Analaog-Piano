\section{Introduction}
Music is one of the key things to please people and itâ€™s based on musical notes. It is so wonderful to observe such notes can be generated by combining electrical signals.

In this device sound of the middle octave, C is mimicked by synthesizing signals. For this purpose, four wien-bridge oscillators have been used to generate sinusoidal waveforms relevant to the major harmonics of the C note. Then these signals are added by a scaling adder and amplified using a Class AB amplifier. A speaker(8$\Omega$ preferred) ranges around 3W could be used with the pinout to observe the sound output. 
\par
The volume of the speaker and the noise level can be adjusted as the user desires. A complete electronic piano can be implemented by combining such modules and changing the essentials accordingly to generate different notes. The following report will elaborate on the experiences and ideas behind the design process.
